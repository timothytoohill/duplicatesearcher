Customer to Unisoft; or (2) At any time if you violate the terms of this
Agreement. Upon termination you shall destroy the written materials and all copies
of the Software, including modified copies, if any. You agree that monetary
damages alone is not an adequate and just relief resulting from any breach of
this License, that a court order prohibiting any further breach of this License
is necessary to prevent further damages, and that you will not oppose any
reasonable request for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction,
or other relief sought by Unisoft in the event of a breach of this License.

any use or distribution in violation of the terms of this License, and you
agree that any breach of this License and damages resulting therefrom shall
relate back to the first and earliest breach thereof. Failure of Unisoft to
enforce its rights pursuant to this License shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights, and shall not prejudice Unisoft in any later enforcement of its
rights or rights to seek damages therefrom. </p>
